# GBMF Phase 6 Aquaculture and Coastal Habitats Mapping for 2024
In support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Oceans and Seafood Markets Initiative, Clark CGA has mapped an inventory of pond aquaculture and coastal habitats in top-producing countries in the global tropics using satellite imagery. The focus of this project is to monitor the rapid development of brackish shrimp aquaculture ponds and the resulting impacts on mangroves and other coastal wetlands through land change analysis. These maps are used by stakeholders worldwide to understand the spatiotemporal transition dynamics of aquaculture and coastal ecosystems to help support conservation practices and sustainability crediting in the seafood industry.
